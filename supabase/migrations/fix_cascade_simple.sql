RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Create a general channel for the new team
    INSERT INTO public.channels (team_id, name, description, created_by)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'general', 'General discussion', NEW.created_by)
    ON CONFLICT (team_id, name) DO NOTHING;
    
    -- Add the team creator as owner in team_members (with proper conflict handling)
    INSERT INTO public.team_members (team_id, user_id, role)
    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.created_by, 'owner')
    ON CONFLICT (team_id, user_id) DO UPDATE SET
        role = EXCLUDED.role;
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
